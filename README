Grammars for generator will look as follows:

start -> line
start -> lines
lines -> line line
lines -> line lines
line -> NUM line
line -> CHAR line

*note* terminals are in all caps, non-terminals in all lower.

SuperGrammar.txt is the active grammer, it interacts with the Generator. I try to run it through the auxillary program TesterV2, which seems to work but I dont capture output.
